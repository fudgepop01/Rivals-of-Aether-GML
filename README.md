## Release Notes

### 1.1.0

bugfixes:
- better syntax highlighting
- fixed issue with the ease_back functions

features:
- **new (basic) visualizer added**!
  - press `Ctrl + P (windows) or Cmd + P (mac)` to bring up the command palette, then
    pick "open RoABox." You'll need to set it up by giving it the proper resources, and for now it's still in its *very*
    early stages, but it still may be helpful to quickly see what a move might look like.

### 1.0.0

Initial release
